# Especial-small-Crowd-generation-js-project
In this project, I try to simulate a small population of especial creatures with possibilites of inheritage between many generations.

## What the hell is this!!!
A society of Bakis. Bakis are transgender virtual creatures that live isolated in a virtual environment. Each individual (baki) has his own character and behavior.
Bakis move in straight lines within their space, and bonus when they strike the borders, so they can't get out of this space. A baki has the following properties:
- Height and width: determines only the physical size of the baki.
- Speed: Baki's movement speed.
- Attractness: determines how much this baki is attractive to other bakis.
- Aggressiveness: determines how much this baki is aggressive with other bakis.
- Power: determines how much this baki powerful in fights with other bakis.
- Adult: determines if the baki can be engaged in a reproduction process.
- Size and colors of the eyes.

### Collision
When two bakis collide, many things are probable. Depending on the character of collided bakbaks results can be:
- If their Attractness values are closer to each other than their Aggressiveness values: then Attractness takes control, and they get many children immediately.
- In the opposite case (Aggressiveness values are closer to each other than their Attractness values): then Aggressiveness takes control, and the most powerfull bakbak killes the other one.
				
*PS: the more you have bakbaks in the society, the more they become aggressive brutal to each other.*
